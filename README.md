# Institute Application
  This is an institute management application created by my team Blaters (Bhavesh Vishwakarma, Mirza Humdaan, Ashish Chaubey and Aman Singh)
  that lead us to the grand finale of national level hackathon "HackaversuuMM'22" organized by "MM(DU), Haryana".
  We have created this application to bridge the gap between the student, teachers and parents.

This is the client side of our project, we have used Kotlin and XML for client side with retrofit to get data from api and to conver it to Kotlin classes.
For the client side we have used Node.js, MySQL and express.js.
This application is built in reagrd to connect the techers, parents, pricipal and students. It is like ERP system but is more focused on student development side.
